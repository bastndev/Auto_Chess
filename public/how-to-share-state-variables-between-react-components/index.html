          When developing React apps, it's quite common to write reusable functional
          components which internal state will be shared by other Hooks. I had to
          do this recently while working on <a href="https://github.com/chesslablab/react-chess">React Chess</a>,
          a React Redux chessboard connected to a chess server.
        </p>

          I managed to share a state variable between multiple components as shown in the animations below.
        </p>
        <img src="figure-01.gif" alt="Figure 1">

        <p>
          As you can see, a dialog pops up when clicking on any of these buttons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Play Online</li>
          <li>Play a Friend</li>
          <li>Play Computer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The thing is you don't want to reinvent the wheel and write the same
          color selection code over and over again. All three dialogs (parents)
          use the same functional component (child) to allow users select the color
          of the pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are the React files involved.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/chesslablab/react-chess/blob/master/src/features/dialog/CreateInviteCodeDialog.js">src/features/dialog/CreateInviteCodeDialog.js</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/chesslablab/react-chess/blob/master/src/features/dialog/createInviteCodeDialogSlice.js">src/features/dialog/createInviteCodeDialogSlice.js</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/chesslablab/react-chess/blob/master/src/features/dialog/PlayOnlineDialog.js">src/features/dialog/PlayOnlineDialog.js</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/chesslablab/react-chess/blob/master/src/features/dialog/playOnlineDialogSlice.js">src/features/dialog/playOnlineDialogSlice.js</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/chesslablab/react-chess/blob/master/src/features/dialog/PlayComputerDialog.js">src/features/dialog/PlayComputerDialog.js</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/chesslablab/react-chess/blob/master/src/features/dialog/playComputerDialogSlice.js">src/features/dialog/playComputerDialogSlice.js</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each dialog has been implemented according to
          <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/">Redux Toolkit</a> best practices.
          The MUI code is written in a file ending with the word <code>Dialog</code> while its
          state management logic is encoded in a
          <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/quick-start#create-a-redux-state-slice">slice</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's two files for each dialog.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>SelectColorButtons</code> is a reusable, self-contained component
          meaning it doesn't need any slice because its state is internal. In other
          words, it doesn't actually make sense for it to be accessed by other components
          globally via a Redux store.
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/programarivm/4af9a3c8a88c8d3a35acd928fb7835c8.js"></script>
        <p>
          <code>SelectColorButtons</code> basically receives the <code>props</code>
          from a parent component and changes its value whenever an icon button
          is clicked on.
        </p>
<pre>
const handleSelectColor = (color) => {
  setColor(color);
};
</pre>
        <p>
          This is achieved by the <code>handleSelectColor()</code> function working
          along with React's <code>useEffect</code> Hook which listens for a state
          change in the color variable.
        </p>
<pre>
React.useEffect(() => {
  props.color = color;
}, [color]);
</pre>
        <p>
          That's it!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let's have a look at the other way around.
        </p>
        <p>
          The code of the parent components is perhaps a different story.
          A harsh truth nobody wants to hear about but it's worth saying is that
          full-stack web development may not be too obvious at times.
          Probably this is the case with React Chess provided that it communicates
          with both an API and a WebSocket server.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not the purpose of this post to go into the details of how React Chess works.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I've removed the lines of code for the sake of simplicity to focus
          on what really matters. Remember, we want a state variable to be shared
          between components in a simple way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's have a look at <code>PlayComputerDialog</code> as an example.
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/programarivm/2c28b2fc1e8fad001f247bc7fa9a0d0f.js"></script>
        <p>
          The <code>useState</code> Hook is used in <code>PlayComputerDialog</code>
          to manage the internal state of the dialog. The object variable
          <code>fields</code> holds the two values required to play the computer:
          <code>level</code> and <code>color</code>.
        </p>
<pre>
const [fields, setFields] = React.useState({
  level: 1,
  color: 'rand'
});
</pre>
        <p>
          The dialog fields are passed to the child component as <code>props</code>.
        </p>
<pre>
&lt;SelectColorButtons props={fields} /&gt;
</pre>
        <p>
          Thus, the user can select a color in the child component while the
          parent gets automatically updated via the <code>fields</code> variable.
        </p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          A simple way to share a state variable between a parent and a child
          component is to make sure that the former passes it to the latter as
          <code>props</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this example, we've seen how the <code>fields</code> of
          <code>PlayComputerDialog</code> are passed to <code>SelectColorButtons</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>props.color</code> is then updated in the child component whenever
          its internal state changes. This is achieved by React's <code>useEffect</code>
          Hook which listens for a state change in the <code>color</code> variable.
