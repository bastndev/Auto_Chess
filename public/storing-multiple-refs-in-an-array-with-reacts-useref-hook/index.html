        <p>
          If you're a JavaScript developer learning React, at some point you'll want
          to create interactive animations with CSS and JavaScript. A plethora of
          amazing animations and transitions can be created easily with CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, JavaScript can definitely help when it comes to creating animations
          programmatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          In plain JavaScript, you'll typically need to select DOM elements for
          further processing which can be done in several ways using the
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document">Document API</a>.
          Probably the most widely used methods to achieve this are <code>getElementById()</code>
          and <code>getElementsByClassName()</code> but there are
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_elements.asp">a few more</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far so good.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thing is that recently, I had to animate the chess pieces of a React
          chessboard and initially was tempted to use the Document API. After some
          consideration I went for a solution based on plain JavaScript. I was impressed
          that my JS animation kind of worked, apparently. It wouldn't take long to realize
          that in some instances it seemed as if something wasn't working as expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I learned about <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html">React refs</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Selecting elements in React is a different story than with JavaScript mainly
          because in React there's a thing called <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html">virtual DOM</a>.
          So what you'd typically do in JavaScript using <code>getElementById()</code> or
          <code>getElementsByClassName()</code> in React should better be done with
          the <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef">useRef</a>
          Hook along with the <code>ref</code> attribute.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following example considers one element.
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/programarivm/75e42876e4fa20b09c86559eae3c2fb6.js"></script>
        <p>
          This way the targeted node can easily be accessed with the <code>current</code>
          property. Now, what if you're dealing with an array of references rather
          than with a single one? Well, in this case there's a solution based on arrays.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me show you an example. Attached below is the code of the <code>Board</code>
          component of <a href="https://github.com/chesslablab/react-chess">React Chess</a>.
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/programarivm/89260aa40def3255802b203efb3f1565.js"></script>
        <p>
          The working code is available on GitHub but I've removed some lines of
          code in this example for the sake of simplicity to focus on what really matters.
          A reference to each square and piece is being attached for further
          access by common utilities.
        </p>
<pre>
const sqsRef = useRef([]);
const imgsRef = useRef([]);
</pre>
        <p>
          The <code>Board</code> component loops through the <code>state.board.history</code>
          array in search for specific elements to render the corresponding squares
          and pieces.
        </p>
        <img src="figure-01.png" alt="Figure 1">
        <p>
          The figure above shows how <code>state.board.history</code> looks like
          after the Caro-Kann Defense 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 has been played in analysis mode.
          It contains five elements at that stage each representing a chess position.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 4th element is described below as an example.
        </p>
        <img src="figure-02.png" alt="Figure 2">
        <p>
          A common utility called <code>Ascii.fromIndexToAlgebraic()</code> is used
          to get a chess square in algebraic notation given a pair of matrix indices
          <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>. The name of the chess square is then
          stored in <code>payload.sq</code>.
        </p>
<pre>
ref={el => sqsRef.current[payload.sq] = el}
</pre>
        <p>
          All 64 squares as well as the remaining pieces of the board can be referenced
          in a user-friendly way — a1, a2 and so on — via an associative array.
        </p>
<pre>
ref={el => imgsRef.current[payload.sq] = el}
</pre>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          An associative array is a convenient way to group multiple refs into a single
          variable. This way, each element can be accessed through a user-friendly
          name. In this example two arrays have been created. <code>sqsRef</code> is
          to access the squares while <code>imgsRef</code> is to access the pieces.
          The elements in both arrays are accessed in a user-friendly way by using a
          chess square name in algebraic notation; for example, a1.
