        <p>
          Rate limiting is about implementing security policies to control how much
          network traffic a particular service will receive. One of its purposes is
          to mitigate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">DoS (Denial of Service) attacks</a>
          by cybercriminals. It is a crucial part of any hardening strategy and can be implemented in several
          different layers of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">OSI</a>
          and <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP_model">TCP/IP</a> architecture stacks.
        </p>
        <h4>Hardening TCP Services</h4>
        <p>
          The transport layer in the TCP/IP model includes three protocols: TCP,
          UDP and SCTP. In today's post, I'll show you the simplest possible way
          to rate-limit a TCP service such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP or SMTP.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, you may want to block IP addresses trying to connect to a
          WebSocket server more than N times per minute.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're a DevOps person or a full-stack developer, probably you've
          heard about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables">iptables</a>
          which is a popular command line tool used to configure the Linux kernel
          firewall.
        </p>
        <p>
          But iptables rules can be complicated to set up if you donâ€™t have too
          much experience with Linux and TCP/IP networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The good news is, you don't need to be an expert system admin to configure
          a Linux firewall, especially if creating a sandbox server with little
          traffic at the beginning.
        </p>
        <h4>Uncomplicated Firewall Comes to the Rescue</h4>
        <p>
          <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall">ufw</a> is a
          frontend for iptables.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is the simple approach that I took to harden my WebSocket server
          in the blink of an eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Uncomplicated Firewall is already installed in Ubuntu out-of-the-box.
          If you're using Debian or any other Linux distro without it by default,
          it can be installed as described next.
        </p>
<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install ufw
</pre>
        <p>
          This is how to find out the status of the firewall.
        </p>
<pre>
$ sudo ufw status
</pre>
        <p>
          And this is how to enable it.
        </p>
<pre>
$ sudo ufw enable
Firewall is active and enabled on system startup
</pre>
        <p>
          Beware, if enabling ufw through an SSH connection the following message
          will pop up.
        </p>
<pre>
Command may disrupt existing ssh connections. Proceed with operation (y|n)?
</pre>
        <p>
          I said yes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just after proceeding with the operation, I decided to close all ports
          by implementing a deny policy by default.
        </p>
<pre>
$ sudo ufw default deny
Default incoming policy changed to 'deny'
(be sure to update your rules accordingly)
</pre>
        <p>
          This means Ubuntu Server won't accept any incoming connections.
        </p>
<pre>
$ sudo ufw status verbose
Status: active
Logging: on (low)
Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), disabled (routed)
New profiles: skip
</pre>
        <p>
          If using SSH to connect to the server it is crucial to explicitly open
          the SSH port so that it can be SSHed, otherwise, the existing connection
          will be disrupted.
        </p>
<pre>
$ sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
Rule added
Rule added (v6)
</pre>
        <p>
          Then, put into practice the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of least privilege</a>.
          I opened port 8443 because apart from port 22 this is the only one which
          needs to be accessed from anywhere on the Internet.
        </p>
<pre>
$ sudo ufw allow 8443/tcp
Rule added
Rule added (v6)
</pre>
        <p>
          By the way, it is a good idea to make sure everything is going as expected.
        </p>
<pre>
$ sudo ufw status verbose
Status: active
Logging: on (low)
Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), disabled (routed)
New profiles: skip
To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere
8443/tcp                   ALLOW IN    Anywhere
22/tcp (v6)                ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
8443/tcp (v6)              ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
</pre>
        <p>
          Thus, here is how to list the actual iptables rules that the Uncomplicated
          Firewall will write for us newbies.
        </p>
        <p>
          IPv4 rules:
        </p>
<pre>
$ sudo iptables -S
</pre>
        <p>
          IPv6 rules:
        </p>
<pre>
$ sudo ip6tables -S
</pre>
        <p>
          As said previously this works for all TCP-based services. If you were
          running, let's say an HTTPS server instead of a WSS server, you might
          want to run the following command instead.
        </p>
<pre>
$ sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
Rule added
Rule added (v6)
</pre>
        <p>
          It is worth mentioning that if a port is opened by mistake, no problem,
          it can be easily closed.
        </p>
<pre>
$ sudo ufw delete allow 443/tcp
Rule deleted
Rule deleted (v6)
</pre>
        <h4>WSS Hardening With UFW Is Easy Peasy</h4>
        <p>
          ufw allows to rate-limit TCP network services as shown below.
        </p>
        <p>
          SSH:
        </p>
<pre>
$ sudo ufw limit 22/tcp
Rule updated
Rule updated (v6)
</pre>
        <p>
          WSS:
        </p>
<pre>
$ sudo ufw limit 8443/tcp
Rule updated
Rule updated (v6)
</pre>
        <p>
          Firewall status:
        </p>
<pre>
$ sudo ufw status verbose
Status: active
Logging: on (low)
Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), disabled (routed)
New profiles: skip
To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22/tcp                     LIMIT IN    Anywhere
8443/tcp                   LIMIT IN    Anywhere
22/tcp (v6)                LIMIT IN    Anywhere (v6)
8443/tcp (v6)              LIMIT IN    Anywhere (v6)
</pre>
        <p>
          This way IP addresses trying to establish a connection to ports 22 and 8443,
          6 or more times in 30 seconds, will be blocked. The user rules are automatically
          written in <code>/etc/ufw/user.rules</code> and <code>/etc/ufw/user6.rules</code>.
