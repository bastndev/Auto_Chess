        <p>
          A reason why <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> is often preferred
          over plain React is for SEO purposes. Unlike the single page application
          (SPA) paradigm where the server sends all of the application's code in
          one single HTTP request, with Next.js the HTML code of the page is generated
          on each request.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is uncomplicated to find out whether or not a web app is an SPA or an MPA.
          Just visit the web page you want to inspect, right-click on it and then
          click on the <b>View page source</b> button.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the source code contains a few dozen of lines with plenty of different
          HTML tags such as <code>main</code>, <code>article</code>, <code>section</code>,
          <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code>, <code>p</code>,
          in other words, if there's search engine indexable content, chances are
          it is a multi-page site. Instead, if the code contains few lines and
          basically what it does is load one or more JavaScript files most likely
          it is a single-page application.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.chesslablab.com">chesslablab.com</a> is an example
          of SPA using plain React.
        </p>
        <img src="figure-01.avif" alt="Figure 1">
        <p>
          Right-click on <a href="https://www.chesslablab.com">chesslablab.com</a>
          and view the page source. The source code of the main page hardly
          contains any HTML tags.
        </p>
        <p>
          To some extent, server-side rendering (SSR) with JavaScript pretty much
          resembles the classical multi-page web application (MPA) paradigm which
          has been out there for years. A main difference though in my opinion is
          that SSR with JavaScript is way more complicated than SSR with a
          classical server-side programming language like PHP, Python, Java or Ruby.
        </p>
        <p>
          Server-side programming languages are easier to learn than Next.js. A
          great example is the <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> framework
          for PHP which is a popular choice among web developers to create apps
          effortlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
          But did you know there's a way for web crawlers to index the HTML content
          of a plain React app?
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's say you're working on a non-indexable plain React app and want to
          write search engine indexable content for the About page while staying
          away from the intricacies of server-side rendering with Next.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because you want to do things effortlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this particular case, you just have to create a subfolder called
          <code>about</code> inside the <code>public</code> folder, and then write
          the HTML content in a new file called <code>index.html</code>. This is
          precisely what I did to get the content of chesslablab.com, which is a
          React app created with <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">create-react-app</a>,
          indexed by search engines.
        </p>
        <img src="figure-02.avif" alt="Figure 2">
        <p>
          As you can see there's another page called <b>Documentation</b> with
          lots of technical content intended for web developers. It is working
          quite well for keywords like <em>chess api</em>.
        </p>
        <img src="figure-03.avif" alt="Figure 3">
        <p>
          Right-click on <a href="https://www.chesslablab.com/documentation/">chesslablab.com/documentation</a>
          and view the page source.
        </p>
        <img src="figure-04.avif" alt="Figure 4">
        <p>
          The source code of the documentation page contains plenty of HTML tags.
          It is available in the <a href="https://github.com/chesslablab/website">chesslablab/website</a>
          repo on GitHub. This approach works out quite well as long as the content
          to be indexed is static.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, if you're a static site generator (SSG) developer who doesn't want
          to mess around with Next.js, or just feel comfortable with manually editing
          HTML files, you may want to write your pages in the public folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope this approach will be helpful to you.
        </p>

          Thank you so much for reading!
