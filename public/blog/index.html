        <h3>By writing the static content in the public folder</h3>
        <p>
          A reason why Next.js is often preferred over plain React is for SEO purposes.
          Unlike the single page application (SPA) paradigm where the server sends all
          of the application's code in one single HTTP request, with Next.js the HTML
          code of the page is generated on each request.

          If you're a JavaScript developer learning React, at some point you'll want
          to create interactive animations with CSS and JavaScript. A plethora of
          amazing animations and transitions can be created easily with CSS.

        <h3>Stop writing the same thing over and over again</h3>
        <p>
          When developing React apps, it's quite common to write reusable functional
          components which internal state will be shared by other Hooks. I had to
          do this recently while working on React Chess, a React Redux chessboard
          connected to a chess server.

        <h3>Here's how the UCI protocol works</h3>
        <p>
          Stockfish is a powerful, widely-used open-source chess engine. Its initial
          release dates back to 2008 and since then has become stronger and stronger
          to the point that today virtually no human can defeat it.

        <h2><a href="/how-to-rate-limit-a-websocket-server">How to Rate-Limit a WebSocket Server</a></h2>
        <h3>This is how I hardened a WebSocket server on Ubuntu</h3>
        <p>
          Rate limiting is about implementing security policies to control how much
          network traffic a particular service will receive. One of its purposes is
          to mitigate DoS (Denial of Service) attacks by cybercriminals. It is a
          crucial part of any hardening strategy and can be implemented in several
          different layers of the OSI and TCP/IP architecture stacks.

        <h3>It is not the right thing to do</h3>
        <p>
          You may end up using real production data instead of sample data because
          of a number of reasons among them tight deadlines or budget constraints.
          In a worst-case scenario, the data is at risk of being sent over email
          in a rush or even shared on Slack or Discord.
