        <p>
          <a href="https://stockfishchess.org/">Stockfish</a> is a powerful,
          widely-used open-source chess engine. Its initial release dates back to
          2008 and since then has become stronger and stronger to the point that
          today virtually no human can defeat it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some would argue this is just boring.
        </p>
        <p>
          What's the point of playing against a program that's going to defeat you anyway?
          Stockfish surpasses by far the highest ELO ever recorded by a human,
          Magnus Carlsen, who holds a peak rating of 2882.
        </p>
        <p>
          Considered one of the best chess engines out there, online chess sites like
          <a href="http://chess.com/">chess.com</a>,
          <a href="http://chess24.com/">chess24.com</a> and
          <a href="http://lichess.org/">lichess.org</a> use it in one way or
          another. If you're an online chess player, probably you've used Stockfish
          unknowingly to analyze a position or play against a bot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides being super strong, one of the reasons behind Stockfish's success
          is that it implements the Universal Chess Interface (UCI) protocol which
          means it can be connected to a graphical user interface (GUI) easily.
          The communication between the chess engine and the GUI is done via standard
          input and output with text commands.
        </p>
        <p>
          UCI is a text-based protocol that humans can understand. If you want to
          play against Stockfish in the Linux terminal a good idea is to have a
          look at the UCI specification.

        <p>
          In today's post, I'm showing how easy it is to play against the most renowned
          chess engine of all time.
        </p>
        <h4>Install Stockfish on a Debian-Based Distro</h4>
        <p>
          Popular Debian-based Linux distros include Ubuntu, Linux Mint, MX Linux
          and Kali Linux among many others. While Linux isn't widely used in desktop
          environments it shines in the server market share.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a perfect time for you to try it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stockfish is distributed under a GPLv3 license and is available for
          installation from the official repositories, just type this in a command-line
          prompt.
        </p>
<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install stockfish
</pre>
        <p>
          Congrats!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now you're ready to play against Stockfish in the terminal without a GUI.
        </p>
        <h4>Play Against Stockfish in the Linux Command Line</h4>
        <p>
          Open a terminal and type the following.
        </p>
<pre>
$ stockfish
</pre>
        <p>
          Now make a move from the start position.
        </p>
<pre>
position startpos move e2e4
</pre>
        <img src="figure-01.webp" alt="Figure 1">
        <p>
          Well done!
        </p>
        <p>
          But hang on a minute, it seems as though nothing has happened despite
          making a chess move even though the state of the board has changed indeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get the information displayed you need to type <code>d</code>.
        </p>
<pre>
d
</pre>
        <img src="figure-02.webp" alt="Figure 2">
        <p>
          It is important to note that Stockfish uses long algebraic notation for
          moves. In long algebraic notation both the starting and ending squares
          are specified while the piece identifier is ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following command asks Stockfish to calculate the best response to
          e4 in 3 seconds.
        </p>
<pre>
go movetime 3000
</pre>
        <img src="figure-03.webp" alt="Figure 3">
        <p>
          The <code>go</code> command prints the best move <code>e7e5</code> on
          the console without changing the state of the board. Thus, if <code>d</code>
          is typed again the output obtained will be the same one as before. You
          need to manually type Stockfish's best move <code>e7e5</code> as described
          in the command below.
        </p>
<pre>
position startpos move e2e4 e7e5
</pre>
        <img src="figure-04.webp" alt="Figure 4">
        <p>
          Remember to type the <code>d</code> command to check out the state of
          the board.
        </p>
<pre>
d
</pre>
        <img src="figure-05.webp" alt="Figure 5">
        <p>
          Now it is White to play, and the move Nf3 is made in long algebraic notation.
        </p>
<pre>
position startpos move e2e4 e7e5 g1f3
</pre>
        <img src="figure-06.webp" alt="Figure 6">
        <p>
          There are multiple different ways to combine commands and parameters,
          for example, moves can be made from a specific FEN position as opposed
          to the start position as in the examples above, but this is pretty much
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope you enjoyed today's post and learned how to play against Stockfish
          in the command line.
